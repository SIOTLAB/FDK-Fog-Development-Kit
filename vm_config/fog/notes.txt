DEVELOPER NOTES:

- installed docker (see below link for instructions), openssh-client, openssh-server, git, emacs, python3
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

Get ssh working:
- sshd_config has sshd configuration, put it at /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
- On reboot sshd.service will be running, can login with user=root, pass=root
- Want to come back and use only ssh keys in the future

Setup communication with SDN controller:
- move fog.service to /etc/systemd/system/
- move fog.py to /usr/src/
- move fog.sh to /usr/bin/
- make sure fog.sh is executable
	> sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/fog.sh
-configure the fog service to run upon startup
	> sudo systemctl enable fog.service

Configure the fog service for your specific network:
- In fog.sh configure SDN controller ip and interface to send messages out on

To manage docker as a non-root user
> sudo groupadd docker
> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$USER --> siotadmin

(^ Permission changes will not take effect until reboot)


Configure remote access to docker daemon with systemd unit file (docker documentation)
Note: Have not secured this connection with TLS yet. . .
- edit docker.service file
> sudo systemctl edit docker.service
- add the following lines
	[Service]
	ExecStart=
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
(at first accidentally set it to tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 and couldn't connect from outside the local host rip. . . don't do this again)
- reload systemctl configuration
> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
- restart docker
> sudo systemctl restart docker.service
- confirm dockerd is listening on the configured port
> sudo netstat -lntp | grep dockerd
