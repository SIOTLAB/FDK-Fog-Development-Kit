Please download the following and place within this folder:

https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5

Then, feel free to clone the FDK onto your fog devices and build the object detection docker image accordingly. Please refer to the Dockerfile if you encounter any issues. Typically you clone fog-development-kit into your $HOME directory and then build the Docker image from that directory.
